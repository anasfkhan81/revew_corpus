Bad Moon Rising (1985)
It was on Bad Moon Rising that the Youth’s wide swirly miasma of influences, from trippy jam rock to punk and free jazz, began to resolve themselves into something new and distinctive and that the band began to start really sounding like themselves. In fact, I got this weird impression of having heard the album before even though (I’m almost certain that) it was my first time hearing it; something which I put down to my familiarity with the rest of the band’s discography and the extent to which they were (subsequently) able to create a sound world so utterly and so unmistakably their own. Indeed SY’s music came to have that welcome familiarity and even intimacy which only the really iconic bands seem to attain to and which eventually comes to feel so natural and spontaneous. That iconic sound is still quite clearly at an embryonic stage on BMR however: that it did not come to the band spontaneously, and that it had taken them a fair few attempts before things finally began to click into place you only need to compare this record to their previous ones to understand; that it would only take them a few more years to perfect you only need to compare BMR (and its immediate successor Evol) with the masterful Sister to appreciate. Interestingly enough the album was born of a conscious attempt on the part of the band to forestall what, they feared, were the signs of an impending creative stasis — which is rather telling of the band’s pioneer attitude given that the Youth were still in reality at the very onset of their careers — something which famously led them to detune all their guitars in a fit of enthusiastic anti-complacency.

Bad Moon Rising then presents a fine showcase of the progress achieved by the band in pursuit of the deeper aesthetic (and melodic) joys immanent in ear-melting guitar feedback. The songs, tracks or pieces, whatever you want to call them, on BMR blend into each other so naturally that it’s often difficult to pick individual favourites from out of the melange. That being said however one of my personal highlights on the album has to be the wide-eyed and evocative ‘I Love Her All the Time’: a hypnotic ballad with the steady, rolling pace of an old-time train journey through the open prairies and a sense of epic, cinema-scale grandeur that feels unmistakably American. And yet this isn’t some kind of pure, ecstatic Kerouakian-On-the-Road style kick, or even, heaven forbid, an alt-1980s update on Cosmic Americana — despite the fact that Lee Renaldo was reputed to have been a big Deadhead in his time. Instead Sonic Youth seem far more attuned to the drearier, more quotidian aspects of life in the hinterlands, something which would help them to appeal to a whole legion of disaffected and marginalised teenagers all across the USA and beyond later on. Thematically the album makes a strong nod to the transgressive/trash aesthetics that were faintly the rage at a certain point in the early-to-mid 80s, although BMR’s mishmash of faintly political slogans, allusions to cheap horror flicks, and pseudo-beatnik poetry comes across as pretty cosmetic: there’s nothing remotely offensive or actually outrageous about this album.

All in all, and despite its importance to the evolution of the band’s overall sound, Bad Moon Rising falls well short of classic status. There’s nothing that really stands out, and certainly no future countercultural teen anthem of the sort that was destined to light up the next few Sonic Youth albums (‘Death Valley 69’ comes close, although in the final count it just seems to lack enough personality). And yet, although it is low on thrills — in comparison to what was to come that is — Bad Moon Rising is by no means a lacklustre record. It is instead a solid effort and engages throughout. The band obviously took great pleasure in coaxing those strange ringing effects from their guitars, but at the same time they have the good manners and the even better taste not to impose this new found joy on the listener’s patience. Nothing outstays its welcome here. Later on they would learn how to assemble these sounds together so as to make them sound not just compelling, but positively symphonic. But for now a decent enough effort from the lads and lass. (6/10)
