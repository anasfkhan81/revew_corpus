Confusion is Sex + Kill Yr Idols (1983)
Confusion is Sex finds Sonic Youth turning away from the urbane modishness and busy pseudo-tribal rhythms of the No Wave scene towards a more static and inwardly focused psycho-cultural aesthetic. Their debut album, it contains clear hints of the brilliance to come. Most importantly of all, the group had already started to manifest that signal openness to experimentation (with texture and dynamics) that would ultimately set them apart as avant-rock pioneers and see them pave the way for at least two generations of guitar bands to come.

CiS is also notable for introducing Kim Gordon’s fantastically sardonic vocals to a wider world. Indeed Gordon’s cover of ‘I Wanna Be Your Dog’, turning the original with its teenage lad backed-up-cum frustration into a howling, lustful, taunt, ripe with sexual self-assurance, is one of the album’s undoubted highlights. Overall though Sonic Youth still sound somewhat wet behind the ears on Confusion is Sex and Kill Yr Idols (the EP which is tacked onto the end of CD editions of Confusion is Sex and which the album inconspicuously segues into). Cycling between primitivist protopunk, buzzing chainsaw guitar, and jumpy ants-in-yer-pants No Wave, they’re never completely convincing, never totally themselves, in any single one of these styles. But then fair’s fair: this was just their first album after all and things were about to get a lot more interesting. (5/10)
