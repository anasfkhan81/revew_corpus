Murray Street (2002)
And so it was that two years down the line from NYCGF and with cheeky avant garde funster Jim O’Rourke firmly ensconced in the role of bass guitarist (thus permitting Kim to focus exclusively on playing electric guitar) our heroes were ready to release their twelfth album:  Murray Street. And, well, there’s no big surprises here: nothing remotely close to a change of musical direction for the band. Instead Sonic Youth were content to carry on with the mellow, conversational pace of their previous two studio albums -- and even though Murray Street clearly suffers at times from the same predilection towards aimless drifting as A Thousand Leaves and NYCGF, there is a noticeable upsurge in terms of musical quality. At the very least you don’t come away from Murray Street with a feeling similar to that of having watched an hour of TV static with a few intermittent clips of actual television shows in between -- as alas you rather tended to do with A Thousand Leaves and NYCGF. In fact it’s heartening to hear the band finally hit upon the sort of effortless poetic flow that they had clearly struggled to attain to on their previous two, namely on songs like Rain on Tin and Karen Revisited. And actually these two, consecutive, tracks are brilliant enough to allow the rest of the album to bask in a reflected glory that it nowhere near deserves; they form the warm nuggety core to the album, a core that’s enveloped all roundabout by a fluffy layer of bland, wholemeal guitar drift. So that although Murray Street should be chalked up as an overall win for the band they still weren’t completely out of the woods yet. (6/10)
