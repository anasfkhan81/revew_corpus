Sonic Youth (1982)
From back in the days when Sonic Youth were more of a posture or a concept than a real band comes the group's eponymous debut EP with the same nervy, chiming guitars and skittery emphasis on rhythm that became so trendy during the great post-punk revival at the turn of the millennium, and which had largely lain dormant up till then. Oddly enough this results in the Sonic Youth EP sounding far more up to date than some of their later releases. But then that *was* the hip, in-sound at the time, at least in the arty Downtown NY milieu that the band inhabited, so I'm not sure how much kudos they should actually get for it. 

Funnily enough prior to hearing this EP I’d always assumed that the band had started off their career by making pure white noise and that this had gradually begun to crystalise over time into more conventional, song-like structures. But in fact that quintessentially amorphous aspect of SY isn’t really present on this their first release. A historical curio at best. (4/10)
